Rahul Gandhi: 'Stop using derogatory language against Smriti Irani… winning and losing happen in life' </b></p><p id="para3"> Weeks after the results of the Lok Sabha elections were announced, Leader of Opposition and Raebareli Rahul Gandhi urged people to “refrain from using derogatory language and being nasty” towards former Union minister Smriti Irani and other leaders.
        Taking to social media platform X, Rahul wrote: “Winning and losing happen in life. I urge everyone to refrain from using derogatory language and being nasty towards Smt. Smriti Irani or any other leader for that matter.”
        He added, “Humiliating and insulting people is a sign of weakness, not strength.”</p></div></div><hr>

A former banker of 23 years old tells how she earned over ₹208,426,135 thanks to AI </b></p><p id="para5"> Renu Bhatnagar, born in New Delhi, managed to buy two houses, a Bentley, a Ferrari and visit 16 countries in just one year. Previously, she worked for minimum wage in one of the Indian banks. So how did she manage to earn so much money in one year? She tells us her story.Renu needed to work a lot because she had a loan for a small one-bedroom apartment, which took more than half of her salary. She lived alone, so she couldn't count on anyone's help. In addition, rising inflation made it increasingly difficult for her to make ends meet at the end of the month. The loan and store prices were rising, unlike Renu's salary."On a rainy day, a regular customer walked into the branch. He was smiling from the entrance, which really surprised me because he had been depressed lately. He sat next to me and told me he wanted to pay off all his loans and open an account that operated overseas, because he was going to take a long vacation."I was very surprised, because in recent months he was late in paying the bills and risked being evicted for having trouble paying the home loan, and now there was a large amount of money in his account. I saw that he had received a transfer of ₹416,852,2 from Trader AI. It was the first time I saw that name...".</p></div></div><hr>

Why Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will not walk out of jail despite interim bail in ED case? </b></p><p id="para7">Though the Supreme Court on Friday granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after he challenged his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the excise policy case, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener will not walk out of jail just yet.

        This is because Kejriwal is still in judicial custody till July 12 in the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI's) corruption case linked to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy.
            
        While granting Kejriwal bail, the bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta referred some questions regarding the need and necessity of the arrest to a larger bench of the Supreme Court.</p></div></div><hr>

Indian 2 movie review: Outmoded and outdated, Kamal Haasan-starrer is a three-hour time suck!</b></p><p id="para8">Twenty eight years back, Kamal Haasan as Indian (in Tamil) and Hindustani (in Hindi) went after the corrupt and the venal, twisting up their innards good and proper before they came to a messy end. The newly-liberalised country cheered for the freedom fighter-turned-vigilante, and viewers were as happy to dance on the graves of the baddies, as they were to gyrate to one of the catchiest tunes ever made in Indian films: 'telephone dhun pe hasne wali, Melbourne machhli machalne wali', with Kamal Haasan and Manisha Koirala showing us their moves.You can still listen to those outlandish lyrics and grin. But there's nothing much to smile at in this sequel no one asked for: Kamal Haasan's prosthetics are still as annoying even if the latex is not as thick and rubbery as it was in the first one, and Indian 2 takes itself and its hero so seriously that you miss the forced humour of the original, even if it landed with a thump.</p></div></div><hr>

Prediabetes vs carbs: Here’s how you can reverse it with smart meals-</b></p><p id="para11">Prediabetes is a critical phase where your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet in the diabetic range. Yet you can reverse this stage and prevent onset of Type 2 diabetes provided you tweak your diet, exercise, sleep well and lead a clean, balanced life. But since diet is the key pivot — considering it has glucose-enhancing carbohydrates — one should look at this macronutrient closely.

            “Carbohydrates break down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood sugar levels. So, these have to be strategically had through the day,” says Dr Richa Chaturvedi, endocrinologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi.</p></div></div><hr>
